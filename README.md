# Task Builder Development Environment Samples
Welcome to Task Builder samples repository. In this git repository you will find all public sample code Microarea distributes in order to support customizations and vertical solutions. All distributed code is intended only as a sample, a suggestion or a best practice: it isn't a real customization and it does not fit for a specific customer or installation. 

This repository is linked with official Task Builder documentation contained into Help Center http://www.microarea.it/MicroareaHelpCenter/Default.aspx

We devided samples in 2 main families: 
* <b>TBS</b>: Task Builder Studio desktop sample code
* <b>TBCloud</b>: Task Builder cloud  sample code

All samples are constructed and tested on latest release version of Mago4 and MagoCloud products.
